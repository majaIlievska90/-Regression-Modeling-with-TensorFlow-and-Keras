# -Regression-Modeling-with-TensorFlow-and-Keras

**Description** 

This project demonstrates my practice with TensorFlow and Keras by training regression models, both linear and nonlinear, using deep neural networks. I queried the World Nations database from the DataCamp platform using SQL to extract data on the population and the number of languages spoken in European countries.

The dataset was then used to train regression models with both single and multiple variables, highlighting key concepts such as feature selection and model evaluation. The project showcases the application of machine learning techniques to real-world data, providing insights into model performance and regression analysis.
